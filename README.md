In this project, I will deconstruct Google's search results page and rebuild it. I will build the page's code from scratch and work extensively with Google Chrome's developer tools for assistance and accuracy.

I will demonstrate utilizing and modifying HTML and CSS code within developer tools as well as a working knowledge of both languages. I will display my ability to work with positioning, colors, external font links, background colors, images, links, aligning elements, columns, borders, box shadows, language specification, inline CSS code, internal CSS code, external CSS code, classes, IDs, and basic forms.
